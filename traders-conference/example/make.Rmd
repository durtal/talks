[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a tool I use for some pretty _simple_ tasks, like building help pages for my R packages, these help pages include [servevolleyR](http://durtal.github.io/servevolleyR/) and [RcappeR](ttp://durtal.github.io/RcappeR/).  However it is a tool I haven't fully explored, so small project has provided an excellent opportunity.  What I will be using Make for is to build a pipeline that goes something like **COLLECT > CLEAN > PROCESS > ANALYSE > OUTPUT**

The makefile below is the current makefile to build this website and collect, clean, process and analyse data.

```{r}
makefile <- paste0(readLines("makefile", warn = FALSE), collapse = "\n")
cat(makefile)
```

#### `collect-tournaments`

The `collect-tournaments` task runs an R script called `collect-tournament-data.R`
