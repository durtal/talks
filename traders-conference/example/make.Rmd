```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE,
               warning = FALSE)

```

[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a tool I use for some pretty _simple_ tasks, like building help pages for my R packages, these help pages include [servevolleyR](http://durtal.github.io/servevolleyR/) and [RcappeR](ttp://durtal.github.io/RcappeR/).  However it is a tool I haven't fully explored, so small project has provided an excellent opportunity.  What I will be using Make for is to build a pipeline that goes something like **COLLECT > CLEAN > PROCESS > ANALYSE > OUTPUT**

```{r}
makefile <- paste0(readLines("makefile", warn = FALSE), collapse = "\n")
cat(makefile)
```
