This website serves as an example workflow using R, Git and Make to automate the [collection](data-collection.html) of tennis data, [cleaning and preparing](data-cleaning.html) that data, before producing output that could be useful in making smarter decisions when striking a bet or bets.

The site is split into 3 sections, [collection](data-collection.html), [cleaning](data-cleaning.html), and output, I've tried to explain the steps I've taken in those sections, these explanations will hopefully improve over time as I have more time.  I will also try to link to useful resources when I use an R package, or some programming _skill_ that may be of interest.
