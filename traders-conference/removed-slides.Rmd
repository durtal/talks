# programming language

***

<ul class="subject-list">
    <li class="name">language designed specifically for data analysis</li>
    <br>
    <li class="name">powerful and flexible</li>
    <br>
    <li class="name">used interactively or write scripts to automate tasks</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
    <p style="font-size:15px">designed by statisticians for statistics, so can appear a little idiosyncratic if coming to R having used other languages</p>
    <p style="font-size:15px">the first language I made an effort to learn, so didn't have any expectations</p>
    <p style="font-size:15px">being a language means code should run day after day</p>
    <p style="font-size:15px">I'll share some examples of using scripts to automate tasks later</p>
